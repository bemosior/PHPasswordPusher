$aboutText = 'PHPasswordPusher is a PHP port of the PasswordPusher project, which provides
        a more secure method for sharing sensitive information like passwords) with
        others. It operates on the principle that using a soon-to-be-expiring link
        to retrieve sensitive information is better than having the sensitive
        information persist in email, chat, etc...
        <br/><br/>
        A user will enter the sensitive information (password, etc.) into the pwlink
        script, set a view and time limit, and receive a link. That link is
        communicated to the intended recipient, who then can retrieve the sensitive
        information until the view or time limits are breached.
        <br/><br/>
